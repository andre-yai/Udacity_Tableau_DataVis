This is a project for Udacity Data Analysit Nanaodegree. In this project I wil create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set.



## Step One - Choose a Data Set


## Step Two - Get Organized

- Summary: in no more than 4 sentences, briefly introduce your data visualization and add any context that can help readers understand it

- Design: explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback

- Feedback: include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization

- Resources: list any sources you consulted to create your visualization



## Step Three - Find a Data Story

Explore your data set and craft a message or story around your data!


## Step Four - Create Your Visualization

First, sketch ideas for your visualization. Once you settle on a sketch, explain any design choices in that sketch, such as chart type, visual encodings, and layout, in the Design section of the write-up.



##  Step Five - Get Feedback and Step Six - Document Feedback and Improve the Visualization

- Person 1: 

What do you notice in the visualization?

What questions do you have about the data?

What relationships do you notice?

What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?

Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
