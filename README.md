# Udacity_Tableau_DataVis


This is a project for Udacity Data Analysit Nanaodegree. In this project I wil create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the Human Development Index (HDI).

## Step One - Choose a Data Set 

The dataset that I choose to analyse was the Human Development Index dataset. In this data set we have the human development score and rank for each country along with their life expectancy at birth, mean of educations years and their gross national income.

## Step Two - Get Organized

- Summary: 

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of achievements in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, access to knowledge, and a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions. The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth, the education dimension is measured by mean of years of education for adults aged 25 years and more and expected years of education for children, and the standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. 


- Design: 

I decided to have two dashboards for my project one for the continets and other for the contries.
In the continent dashboard we have a barplot in order to compare the countries in their averages human development index, life expectancy at birth, mean of educations years and their gross national income. We have also a map that has colored with the average HDI score.
In the contries we have a scatterplot also to compare beetween the large amount of countries in our dataset their measures of healthy, education and living (in the size of the symbol) and shaped which countinent they belong. We also have a map to show us exacly were does that country are located and a global sense of the HDI scenario. 

- Feedback: include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization


- Resources: list any sources you consulted to create your visualization

Resources: 

- [UN Human Development Report](http://hdr.undp.org/en/data)
- [UN Human Development Index (HDI)](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi)
- [Kaggle - Human Development Report 2015](https://www.kaggle.com/undp/human-development)


## Step Three - Find a Data Story

Explore your data set and craft a message or story around your data!


## Step Four - Create Your Visualization

First, sketch ideas for your visualization. Once you settle on a sketch, explain any design choices in that sketch, such as chart type, visual encodings, and layout, in the Design section of the write-up.


##  Step Five - Get Feedback and Step Six - Document Feedback and Improve the Visualization
