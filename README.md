# Udacity_Tableau_DataVis


This is a project for Udacity Data Analysit Nanaodegree. In this project I wil create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the Human Development Index (HDI).

## Choose a Data Set 

The dataset that I choose to analyse was the Human Development Index dataset. In this data set we have the human development score and rank for each country along with their life expectancy at birth, mean of educations years and their gross national income.

## Get Organized

- Summary: 

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of achievements in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, access to knowledge, and a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions. The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth, the education dimension is measured by mean of years of education for adults aged 25 years and more and expected years of education for children, and the standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. 


- Design: 

I decided to have two dashboards for my project. One for the countries and another for the continents.

In the contries we have a scatterplot comparing amoung the large amount of countries in our dataset, their measures of healthy (y axis), education (x axis), living (size of the symbol) and continent (shape format). We also have a map that shows exacly were the country is located and a overview of the HDI scenario. I also added a line chart showing the evolution of HDI throughout the years for the selected area in the map.

In the continent dashboard ,we have a barplot in order to compare the countries in their average human development index, life expectancy at birth, mean of educations years and their gross national income per capita. We have also a map that has colored with the average HDI score.


## Find a Data Story

In my dataset the main idea that I am tring to craft is how the picture of the human develpoment index scenario and their measures are in diferent countries and continents.
We can see that the countries with the highest Human Development Index have also better education and a bigger life expectancy. The lowers HDI are located in Africa and the highers in Europe.

- Feedback: include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization

What do you notice in the visualization?
1. The graph description at the top can have a better description of the selected graphs
2. The graphs should show the data sources and years
3. Once the continent is selected, the graph below could change showing just the related countries.

What questions do you have about the data?
1. would be helpful to have a short description of the UN definition for each type of data, for instance, how is calculated the GNI 

What relationships do you notice?
1. I noticed that most of the indexes are related showing that the better GNI means better GNP, lyfe expectancy and study.

What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?
1. The comparison among continents and countries

Is there something you donâ€™t understand in the graphic?
1. No.


Improved Visulization by: 
1. Adding the data reference to my visualization.
2. Editted the visualization discription.
3. Added the feature that once the continent is selected, the graph below could change showing just the related countries.
4. Added a short description from UN about the data.
5. Rearrange the continent statistics for a better view.
