This is a project for Udacity Data Analysit Nanaodegree. In this project I wil create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the Human Development Index (HDI).

## Step One - Choose a Data Set and Step Two - Get Organized

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of achievements in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, access to knowledge, and a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions. The health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth, the education dimension is measured by mean of years of education for adults aged 25 years and more and expected years of education for children, and the standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. 


- Design: explain any design choices you made including changes to the visualization after collecting feedback

In my data visualization I will show the global rank of hdi in a map and a rank of thee dimensions of human development. 

- Feedback: include all feedback you received from others on your visualization from the first sketch to the final visualization


- Resources: list any sources you consulted to create your visualization

Resources: 

- [UN Human Development Report](http://hdr.undp.org/en/data)
- [UN Human Development Index (HDI)](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi)
- [Kaggle - Human Development Report 2015](https://www.kaggle.com/undp/human-development)


## Step Three - Find a Data Story

Explore your data set and craft a message or story around your data!


## Step Four - Create Your Visualization

First, sketch ideas for your visualization. Once you settle on a sketch, explain any design choices in that sketch, such as chart type, visual encodings, and layout, in the Design section of the write-up.


##  Step Five - Get Feedback and Step Six - Document Feedback and Improve the Visualization

- Person 1: 

What do you notice in the visualization?

What questions do you have about the data?

What relationships do you notice?

What do you think is the main takeaway from this visualization?

Is there something you don’t understand in the graphic?
